# MarioPowerUps 1.21.4 (WIP)
A minecraft plugin (will be a mod too) that adds various Mario PowerUps to your server (and to your personal world eventually).

I wouldn't consider myself a **fan** of Mario but all I played most of my childhood was Mario games and till this day I still enjoy playing some Mario games emulated on the PC.
I like to use mario texture packs since I like to bring the world of Mario games into MC so I thought why not make a plugin/mod that will bring something that is more than just the visual
aspect from Mario games, something than you can interact with and feel like it is brought directly from one world to the other, like per example, various PoweUps so I can go around with my 
Fire Flower throwing fire balls everywhere, jumping around by using the Metal Coil, or eat a Rock Mushroom and dash against enemies knocking them off or destroy walls.

#List of PowerUps:

_The list doesnt show all the PoweUps that will be in the plugin/mod, but the ones im planning to make at the moment._

**WIP**: Work In Progress
**NS**: Not Started
**PF**: Partially/Almost Finished (Will still make some small adjustements to make it "perfect", 
or maybe there are still some known but very rare (and hard to fix) bugs 
that are still not fixed and left aside to progress with a new PowerUp)
**CF**: Completely Finished (Wont make any adjustement and there arent any known bugs left)
