# MarioPowerUps Plugin 1.21.4 (WIP)
A minecraft plugin that adds various Mario PowerUps.

I wouldn't consider myself a **fan** of Mario but all I played most of my childhood was Mario games and till this day I still enjoy playing some Mario games emulated on the PC.
I like to use mario texture packs since I like to bring the world of Mario games into MC so I thought why not make a plugin that will bring something that is more than just the visual
aspect from Mario games, something than you can interact with and feel like it is brought directly from one world to the other, like per example, various PowerUps so I can go around with my 
Fire Flower throwing fire balls everywhere, jumping around by using the Metal Coil, or eat a Rock Mushroom and dash against enemies knocking them off or destroy walls...

Also, I will be making a custom texture for each PowerUp.
